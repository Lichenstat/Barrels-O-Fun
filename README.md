Made with gmod 13 libraries
Just put the barrels_o_fun folder in your garrysmod/addons folder to work properly
If you wish to use this mod in/for one of your own mods you have permission to do so!!!

This addon is basically glorified explosive barrels.
The addon comes with 5 explosive barrels that have different properties when exploded. All barrels "respawn" when exploded, essentially making the barrels "indestructible" by normal means.

The 5 barrel types are:
Barrel O Fun - Just a regular explosive barrel, but indestructible.

Barrel O Fun (Freeze) - Barrel freezes in place after it explodes and stays there until touched or affected by a force of some kind.

Barrel O Fun (Random) - When this barrel explodes it will fly off into a random direction with a random force.

Barrel O Fun (Rebound) - Barrel rebounds back roughly in the opposite direction from which it exploded in. This rebound is powered by the barrel's explosion so don't expect the rebounding to take the barrel back halfway across the map.

Barrel O Fun (Spawner) - Makes a spawn point for normal barrels to spawn in.

All the above barrels keep these stated properties when applied to them even after exploding:
- Color
- Material
- Physical properties (gravity bouncy metal, no gravity glass, ect..)
- Weight

Anything else such as constraints will not stay on the barrel after an explosion (think of this in terms of what items would break off in a regular barrel explosion, such as lights, thrusters, or ropes). Remover tool does not remove the barrels as they just respawn themselves when destroyed (except spawner barrel can be removed, as well as right clicking rebound barrel with remover tool). That is why there is an option to remove all Barrels O Fun in user or admin cleanup groups for said user or admin (good logic, I know). Lastly, Duplicator Tool does not duplicate the Barrel O Fun entity, it just duplicates the barrel the entity creates (the barrel you play around with) so it's basically duplicating a normal explosive barrel, sorry. For now this stays like this, if there is a way to change this to work properly in the future I will try but I am low on time and energy right now. Anyhow after that smorgasbord of information I thank you for checking out this addon at the very least, it took a bit to make since I had to do the graphics from scratch and deal with weird source physics, not to mention it was my first time making any addon for Gmod (officially at least).

*Note: This addon was made entirely in the sandbox gamemode, so whether it will work properly in other gamemodes is an uncertainty.
